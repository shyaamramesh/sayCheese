# Smiledetect
A simple smile detection algorithm using openCV and haarCascades.
<br> First using a frontalface cascade we detect the face => Then we use a smile cascade to detect smiles.
<br> The smile cascade works by detecting mouth shapes and when eyes slightly squint.
<br><br> Also if your wondering what a haar cascade is, well it's a huge XML file detailing the structure of something. Nowadays we use machine learning, so i am planning for a V2 using ML.
<br>
<i> To run the program make sure you clone the XML cascade files too ! Run the <code><u>sayCheese.py</u></code><i>
